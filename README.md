During the Bootstrap Section of the course.

1. Use the same Bootstrap 3 CDN we show in the video. This is the same CDN link we use in the videos and the original .zip file. You can access the CDN link and Bootstrap 3.3.7 docs here:

During the Django portion of the course

2. Later on we will discuss virtual environments and installing Django with a conda install or pip install. If you just do pip install django, it will download the latest version, which won't be the same as in the video. So instead use the following command:

pip install django==1.11

Okay that is all!
